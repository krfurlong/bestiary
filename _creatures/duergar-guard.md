***Brave.*** The duergar guard has advantage on saving throws against being frightened.


***Brute.*** A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the duergar gaurd hits with it (included in the attack).

***Duergar Resilience.*** The duergar guard has advantage on saving throws against poison, spells, and illusions, as well as resistance to effects causing charmed or paralyzed.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the duergar guard has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The duergar makes three melee attacks or two ranged attacks.

***Enlarge (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** For 1 minute, the duergar magically increases in size, along with anything it is wearing or carrying. While enlarged, the duergar is Large, doubles its damage dice on Strength-based weapon attacks (included in the attacks), and makes Strength checks and Strength saving throws with advantage. If the duergar lacks the room to become Large, it attains the maximum size possible in the space available.

***War Pick.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage, or 18 (3d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Javelin.*** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft. and range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 11 (2d6 + 4) piercing damage, or 13 (2d8 + 4) piercing damage if used with two hands to make a melee attack.

***Shield Bash.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. Hit: 9 (2d4 + 4) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Medium or smaller creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

***Invisibility (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest).*** The duergar magically turns invisible until it attacks, casts a spell, or uses its Enlarge, or until its concentration is broken, up to 1 hour (as if concentrating on a spell). Any equipment the duergar wears or carries is invisible with it.

***Horn of Demon Summoning (1/day).*** The duergar uses the Horn of Demon Summoning to attempt to summon a demon, which on a success, is friendly. The Horn has a 60% chance of summoning one or more demons.
