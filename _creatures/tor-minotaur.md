* 3/day each: <i>dimension door </i>(self only)<i>, plane shift </i>(self only)


***Fire Absorption.*** Whenever the bronze minotaur is subjected to fire
damage, it takes no damage and instead regains a number of hit points
equal to the fire damage dealt.


***Magic Resistance.*** Tor has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Magic Weapons.*** Tor's weapon attacks are magical.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** Tor makes three attacks: one with his greataxe, one with his cleaver, and one bite.

On a failed save, a creature takes 27 (5d10) thunder damage, drops everything it's holding, and is stunned for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage. The stunned creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

cone of flame. Creatures in the area must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving
throw, taking 52 (15d6) fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as
much damage on a successful one.
