***Legion of Puppets.*** The puppeteer crafts and distributes
Grinning Marionettes. The puppeteer may use its
action to see through the eyes of any of its
marionettes. While seeing through the eyes of a
marionette, the puppeteer is blind to everything
happening around its body. The puppeteer is in
constant telepathic communication with all of its
puppets and they follow its will.

***Innate Spellcasting.*** The puppeteer's innate spellcasting
ability is Charisma (spell save DC 16). It can innately
cast the following spells, requiring no components:

* At will: <i>alter self, charm person, crown of madness</i>

* 1/Day: <i>blight, greater invisibility, mirror image</i>

* 3/Day: <i>dominate person, hold person</i>

***Master Ventriloquist.*** The puppeteer can cast spells
without any somatic or verbal components and can
perfectly mimic any voice it has ever heard.

### Actions

***Multiattack.*** The puppeteer makes three attacks with its
razor strings.

***Razor Strings.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach
15ft., one target. Hit: 10 (2d6 + 4) slashing damage. The strings remain attached to the target until they either use an action to remove them with a DC8 Dex Check or make an attack against them (AC 8, 1HP) to cut the strings.

***Strings Attached (Recharge 5-6).*** The puppeteer
teleports to an unoccupied space within 120 feet and
makes three attacks with its razor strings against a
single target, then casts dominate person on them. If at
least two of puppeteer's attacks hit, the target has
disadvantage on their saving throw against the spell.

### Legendary Actions

***Move.*** The puppeteer moves up to its speed without provoking opportunity attacks.

***Razor String Strike.*** The puppeteer makes one razor string attack. 

***Puppet Dance.*** The puppeteer can make up to 1d4 Grinning Marionettes attack one target within range.

***Cast a spell (Costs 2 Actions).*** The puppeteer casts one spell. 

### Lair Actions

***Create Marionettes.*** The puppeteer instantly creates 1d4 new Grinning Marionettes and places them within 30 feet of it.

***Pull Strings.*** All individuals who currently have strings attached to them must succeed on a DC14 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone.
