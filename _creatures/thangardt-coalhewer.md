***Innate Spellcasting (Psionics).*** The duergar despot's innate spellcasting ability is Intelligence (spell save DC 14). It can cast the following spells, requiring no components:

* At will: <i>mage hand, minor illusion, heat metal, scorching ray</i>

* 1/day each: <i>counterspell, misty step, stinking cloud</i>

***Magic Resistance.*** The duergar has advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects.

***Legendary Resistance (3/Day).*** If the duergar fails a saving throw, it can choose to succeed instead.

***Psychic Engine.*** When the duergar despot suffers a critical hit or is reduced to 0 hit points, psychic energy erupts from its frame to deal 14 (4d6) psychic damage to each creature within 15 feet of it.

***Sunlight Sensitivity.*** While in sunlight, the duergar despot has disadvantage on attack rolls, as well as on Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.

### Actions

***Multiattack*** The despot makes two iron fist attacks and two stomping foot attacks. It can replace up to two of these attacks with uses of its Flame Jet and up to one of these attacks with its Psyonic Blast.

***Iron Fist*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 14 (2d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage. If the target is a Large or smaller creature, it must make a successful DC 17 Strength saving throw or be thrown up to 30 feet away in a straight line. The target is knocked prone and then takes 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage.

***Stomping Foot*** Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (1d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage, or 18 (3d8 + 5) bludgeoning damage to a prone target.

***Flame Jet*** The duergar spews flames in a line 100 feet long and 5 feet wide. Each creature in the line must make a DC 16 Dexterity saving throw, taking 18 (4d8) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

***Mind Mastery*** The duergar targets up to three creatures it can see within 60 feet of it. Each target must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw, or the duergar causes it to use its reaction either to make one weapon attack against another creature the duergar can see or to move up to 10 feet in a direction of the duergar's choice. Creatures that can't be charmed are immune to this effect.

### Legendary Actions

Thangardt Coalhewer can take 3 legendary actions, choosing from the options below. Only one legendary action option can be used at a time, and only at the end of another creature's turn. He regains spent legendary actions at the start of his turn.

***Detect.*** The duergar makes a Wisdom (Perception) check.

***Weapon Attack.*** The duergar makes a Iron Fist or Stomping Foot attack.

***Command Ally.*** The warlord targets one ally it can see within 30 feet of it. if the target can see and hear the warlord, the target can make one weapon attack as a reaction and gains advantage on the attack roll.

***Spellcasting.*** The Duergar casts a spell from its innate spellcasting ability.

***Mind Blast (Costs 2 Actions).*** The duergar channels psionic energy stored in the *Krystallsjel* **(Soul Gem)** to emit a burst of energy in a 60-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 14 Intelligence saving throw. On a failure, the mind blast deals damage equal to the 3+1d8 times the number of charges stored in the *Krystallsjel* and stuns the individual for one turn (if less than 4 charges) or potentially two turns (if 4-5 charges). A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

### Lair Actions

On initiative count 20, the *Charge Krystallsjel* event occurs as well as a random event given by the table below:

***Charge Krystallsjel.*** The *Krystallsjel* gains one charge to a max of five charges.

***1: Open Window to the Descent.*** All hostile individuals within 30 feet of the the window must make a DC15 Wisdom saving throw or be frightened of the Descent for the next minute. 

***2: Summon Snakes.*** A Swarm of Poisonous Snakes is summoned forth from the pool of water - it roles its own initiative.

***3: Volcanic Pulse.*** A tremor emits from Tharmekhul causing the entire interior to shake. All hostile creatures must make a DC15 Strength saving throw or fall prone and take 1d6 bludgeoning damage.

***4: Fracture Krystallsjel.*** A shard of the Krystallsjel breaks off causing a blast of confusion to pulse throughout the room. All creatures must make a DC15 Wisdom saving throw or suffer from the effects of the Confusion Spell until the end of their next turn.

***5: Whispers from the Mouths.*** An imperceptible at first but growing ever louder tide of whispers begins filling the air around the pool of water. All creatures within 15 feet of the water must make a DC15 Charisma saving throw or be charmed by the whispers to use their movement to jump in the water. The whispers cannot be heard by anyone outside of the 15 foot area surrounding the pool.

***6: Siphon Mositure.*** The force from within the pool of water inhales and sucks moisture out of the air and of every orifice of those in the room. All individuals must make a DC15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one point of exhaustion. Additionally, the pool of water grows 5 feet closer to the floor.
