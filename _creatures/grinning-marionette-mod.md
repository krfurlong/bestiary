***Bound Servitude.*** All marionettes serve a Grim
Puppeteer. This master can use its action to see
through the marionette's eyes and the marionette can
communicate with its master from anywhere. The
marionette is forced to execute the orders of its master
to the best of its abilities. The marionette becomes a
mundane doll if its master is killed.

***False Appearance.*** While the marionette remains
motionless, it is indistinguishable from an ordinary doll.

***Pack Tactics.*** The marionette has advantage on an attack roll against a creature if at least one of the marionette's allies is within 5 ft. of the creature and the ally isn't incapacitated.

### Actions

***Draining Touch.*** Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach
5ft., one target. Hit: 4 (1d4 + 2) bludgeoning damage
and the target must succeed on a DC 11 Constitution
saving throw or take an additional 2 (1d4) necrotic
damage.

***Nightmare Gaze.*** The marionette gazes at one creature it can see within 30 feet of it. The target must make a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target succumbs to a magical slumber, falling unconscious for 1 minute or until someone uses an action to shake the target awake. While asleep, the targets dream terrible things causing 3 (1d6) psychic damage at the start of their turn. The target may re-roll their saving throw at the end of each of their turns while asleep.
